  abstract = {{H(div) conforming and discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are designed for incompressible Euler’s equation in two and three dimension. Error estimates are proved for both the semidiscrete method and fully-discrete method using backward Euler time stepping. Numerical examples exhibiting the performance of the methods are given.}},
